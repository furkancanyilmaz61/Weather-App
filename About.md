Phase 1: PLANNING
Define the App's Purpose:
A Weather App that fetches real-time weather data for any city and displays the temperature, weather conditions, and forecast.
Features to Include:
Search by city name.
Display real-time weather data (temperature, description, icon).
Support for multiple cities.
Option to view 7-day forecasts (optional).


Phase 2: SETUP
Environment Setup:
Install a code editor (e.g., VS Code).
Create a project folder (e.g., weather-app).
Add files:
index.html
style.css
script.js
Install Dependencies (if needed):
Use Bootstrap for quick styling (optional).
Link any required libraries (e.g., Axios for API calls).


Phase 3: API INTEGRATION
Choose a Weather API:
Options: OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or AccuWeather.
Obtain an API Key:
Sign up and generate an API key.
Understand the API Structure:
Read API documentation.
Find endpoints for current weather and forecast (e.g., /weather for current weather, /forecast for 7-day forecast).
Test the API:
Use Postman or the browser to make sample API calls and check responses.


Phase 4: BUILD THE UI
HTML Structure:
Add a search bar for city input.
Add placeholders for weather information (temperature, description, and icon).
Optional: Add a forecast section for future weather.
CSS Styling:
Create a visually appealing design using CSS or Bootstrap.
Style the search bar and weather result containers.
Responsive Design:
Ensure the app looks good on all devices.


Phase 5: JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONALITY
Fetch Weather Data:
Use the Fetch API or Axios to make calls to the weather API.
Display Data:
Parse the JSON response from the API.
Update the DOM with weather details (temperature, description, and icon).
Handle User Input:
Add an event listener to the search form.
Validate the input (e.g., check if the input field is empty).
Error Handling:
Show an error message if the city is not found.
Handle API errors (e.g., invalid API key).


Phase 6: TESTING
Test Different Cities:
Ensure the app works for various cities (e.g., London, Tokyo, New York).
Test Edge Cases:
What happens if the user enters invalid input or leaves the search field blank?
